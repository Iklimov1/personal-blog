<p>The morning felt unhurried.
Emails waited.
The kettle didn’t.</p>

<p>I’m learning how to let a day stay small without apologizing for it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I worked through AWS notes slowly,
writing things down by hand,
not optimizing anything.</p>

<p>By evening, the house smelled like sugar and butter.
That felt like enough.</p>
