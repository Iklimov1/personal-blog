Today was a piece of work. I am actually writing this on sunday evening because I am currently testing the files to be uploaded and OH MAN! is it ever annoying to work with Jekyll and GitHub Pages (I hope github that you're reading this.) I have moved through the stages of grief into anger/acceptance that. I will need to sink time into the journal template like I spent time on the front page, which I love! I was inspired to create a blog when I realize dhow easy it is to pour one's thoughts into the internet. Also inspired by none other than Ezra koenigs internet vibes blog. I recently watched "Neo Yokio" as well so it's kind of been an Ezra Weekend in general (more to come on my review of Neo Yokio.)

Above are the many designs which inspired the blog's design. It has definitely gone through a metamorphosis during the past 3-4 days with a real sleeping beauty moment (pink! no blue!.) I had to settle on the obvious pink design to live out the days I only like green and blue as a child.
