The morning felt unhurried.
Emails waited.
The kettle didn’t.

I’m learning how to let a day stay small without apologizing for it.

In the afternoon, I worked through AWS notes slowly,
writing things down by hand,
not optimizing anything.

By evening, the house smelled like sugar and butter.
That felt like enough.
